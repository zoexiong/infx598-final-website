##Describes what you built:
####We curated LGBTQ related information to let people learn more about this community. 
* We use **API** from [**twitter**](https://twitter.com) to gather data and display latest tweets about LGBTQ on our map. (We use map framework provided by [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/))
* We made an **interactive visualization** for the **socioeconomic characteristics** of same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples in the United States. It intends to explore how couplesâ€™ sexual orientation, education, and employment would impact their household income.
* A dynamic news page featuring latest **LGBTQ related news**. News is fetched from different sites using [**bing.com**](https:bing.com) news search API.
